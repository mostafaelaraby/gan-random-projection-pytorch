# GAN Random Projection
In this repo an implementation of DCGAN and comparing its results when we use a single discriminator versus using a set of discriminator each one of them on a different projection of the data.

We use random filters fixed throughout the training, these filters are then applied to input images from the data distribution or data generated by the generator. These random projection are then sent to a set of discriminators each working on a specific filter.

The notebook is commented and contains already generated images.
